# Latent Space Reasoning in Engram

Engram now includes a powerful latent space reasoning system inspired by Meta's Coconut research. This feature enables iterative thought refinement and deeper reasoning capabilities for Tekton components.

## Overview

The latent space reasoning system allows components to:

1. Initialize thoughts in a dedicated latent space
2. Refine thoughts through multiple iterations
3. Track the reasoning process
4. Finalize and persist insights
5. Retrieve complete reasoning traces

## Core Components

### LatentMemorySpace

The foundational class that implements latent space memory:

```python
class LatentMemorySpace:
    async def initialize_thought(self, thought_seed, component_id=None, metadata=None)
    async def refine_thought(self, thought_id, refinement, metadata=None)
    async def finalize_thought(self, thought_id, final_content=None, persist=True)
    async def get_reasoning_trace(self, thought_id, include_iterations=False)
```

### LatentSpaceManager

Manages all latent spaces across the system:

```python
class LatentSpaceManager:
    async def create_component_space(self, component_id, space_id=None)
    def get_shared_space()
    def get_component_spaces(self, component_id)
    async def list_spaces()
```

### LatentInterface

A high-level, user-friendly interface for components:

```python
class LatentInterface:
    async def think_iteratively(self, initial_thought, refinement_function, max_iterations=3)
    async def recall_thinking_process(self, thought_id, include_iterations=True)
    async def list_active_thoughts()
```

## Usage Example

Here's a simple example of using the latent space for iterative reasoning:

```python
from engram.core import LatentInterface

# Initialize latent interface
latent = LatentInterface(component_id="my-component")

# Define a refinement function (in real usage, this would likely use an LLM)
def refine_thought(thought):
    # Improve the thought somehow
    improved = f"{thought}\n\nAdditional insight: ..."
    confidence = 0.7  # Confidence in this refinement
    return improved, confidence

# Perform iterative thinking
result = await latent.think_iteratively(
    initial_thought="Initial problem analysis: ...",
    refinement_function=refine_thought,
    max_iterations=5,
    confidence_threshold=0.9
)

# Access the final result
print(f"Final thought: {result['final_thought']}")
print(f"Iterations required: {result['iterations']}")
print(f"Final confidence: {result['confidence']}")

# Retrieve the complete reasoning process
trace = await latent.recall_thinking_process(result["thought_id"])
```

## Integration with Other Tekton Components

### Prometheus Integration

Prometheus can use latent space reasoning to refine planning:

```python
from engram.core import LatentInterface

class PlanningEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.latent = LatentInterface(component_id="prometheus")
        
    async def generate_plan(self, goal):
        # Generate initial plan
        initial_plan = self._create_initial_plan(goal)
        
        # Refine the plan using latent space reasoning
        result = await self.latent.think_iteratively(
            initial_thought=initial_plan,
            refinement_function=self._refine_plan,
            max_iterations=3
        )
        
        return result["final_thought"]
```

### Ergon Integration

Agents can use latent space for deeper reasoning:

```python
class AgentReasoning:
    def __init__(self, agent_id):
        self.agent_id = agent_id
        self.latent = LatentInterface(component_id=f"ergon-{agent_id}")
        
    async def solve_problem(self, problem_description):
        # Use iterative reasoning to solve the problem
        result = await self.latent.think_iteratively(
            initial_thought=f"Problem analysis: {problem_description}",
            refinement_function=self._refine_solution
        )
        
        return {
            "solution": result["final_thought"],
            "reasoning_process": result["refinements"]
        }
```

## Advanced Features

### Shared vs. Private Spaces

Components can choose between shared and private latent spaces:

```python
# Private space for component-specific reasoning
private_latent = LatentInterface(component_id="component-1", shared=False)

# Shared space for cross-component insights
shared_latent = LatentInterface(shared=True)
```

### Persistent Reasoning Traces

All thought processes can be persisted and retrieved later:

```python
# Retrieve a historical thought process
trace = await latent.recall_thinking_process("thought-12345")

# List all thoughts in your latent space
all_thoughts = await latent.list_all_thoughts()
```

### Custom Refinement Logic

You can implement custom logic for thought refinement:

```python
def adaptive_refinement(thought):
    # Analyze the thought to determine next steps
    if "needs more analysis" in thought:
        # Perform deeper analysis
        return deep_analysis(thought), 0.6
    elif "requires examples" in thought:
        # Add examples
        return add_examples(thought), 0.8
    else:
        # Finalize the thought
        return finalize_thought(thought), 0.95
```

## Implementation Details

### Thought States

Thoughts progress through distinct states:

1. `ThoughtState.INITIAL` - Initial thought entry
2. `ThoughtState.REFINING` - Undergoing refinement iterations
3. `ThoughtState.FINALIZED` - Completed thought process
4. `ThoughtState.ABANDONED` - Abandoned before completion

### Memory Management

The system automatically manages memory to prevent unbounded growth:

- Hierarchical summarization for long thoughts
- Automatic pruning of intermediate steps
- Selective persistence of significant iterations
- Context partitioning for efficient storage

## Future Enhancements

Future developments for the latent space system include:

1. Advanced convergence detection using embeddings
2. Cross-component insight propagation mechanisms
3. Integration with Sophia for automated self-improvement
4. Visualization tools for reasoning traces
5. Optimization for resource-constrained environments
