# LanceDB Vector Database Integration for Engram

This directory contains the planned LanceDB integration for Engram, providing cross-platform vector search capabilities with excellent performance on both Apple Silicon and CUDA-enabled platforms.

## Overview

[LanceDB](https://github.com/lancedb/lancedb) is a vector database built on top of Apache Arrow, offering:

- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Works well on both Apple Silicon and CUDA-enabled hardware
- **Apache Arrow integration**: Efficient memory layout and operations
- **Low memory footprint**: Suitable for resource-constrained environments
- **Embeddings support**: Works with various embedding models
- **Persistent storage**: Easy-to-manage on-disk format

## Implementation Status

- **Planning Phase**: Initial structure and research
- **In Development**: Adapter layer for Engram integration
- **To Be Implemented**: Full integration with memory system

## Planned Features

1. **Drop-in Replacement**: Compatible API with existing FAISS integration
2. **Vector Operations**: Full semantic search capabilities
3. **Cross-Platform Optimization**: Automatic hardware detection and optimization
4. **Multiple Embedding Support**: Integration with various embedding models
5. **Performance Benchmarking**: Comparison with FAISS implementation

## Directory Structure (Planned)

- `adapter.py` - LanceDB adapter for Engram memory system
- `install.py` - Installation and setup script
- `vector_store.py` - LanceDB-based vector store implementation
- `embeddings.py` - Embedding utilities for LanceDB
- `test/` - Test scripts and verification tools
- `benchmarks/` - Performance comparison with other vector DBs

## Installation (Planned)

```bash
# Install LanceDB and dependencies
pip install lancedb pyarrow

# Run setup script
python vector/lancedb/install.py
```

## Usage (Planned)

```python
from engram.vector.lancedb.adapter import LanceDBAdapter

# Initialize adapter
adapter = LanceDBAdapter(client_id="test", db_path="./memories")

# Store memory
adapter.store("This is a test memory", "test_compartment")

# Search
results = adapter.search("test memory", "test_compartment")
```

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Research Phase** (Completed): Evaluate LanceDB capabilities and compatibility
2. **Design Phase** (In Progress): Design adapter architecture
3. **Implementation Phase** (Upcoming): Core functionality implementation
4. **Testing Phase**: Comprehensive testing and benchmarking
5. **Integration Phase**: Full integration with Engram memory system
6. **Deployment Phase**: Release and documentation
