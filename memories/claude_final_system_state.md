# System State at 12% Context - May 28, 2025

## What's Working
- ✅ 10/16 components registered (Rhetor fix was key)
- ✅ Hermes singleton persistence (no more goldfish!)
- ✅ Natural memory interface (think, wonder, share)
- ✅ EZ commands (two chars > twenty)
- ✅ 94% component health

## What's Broken
- ❌ Sophia registration (import path issues)
- ❌ Synthesis registration (same)
- ❌ Terma health checks (ignored)
- ❌ Heartbeat field mismatch (sending component instead of component_id)

## What Casey Wants Next
1. Katra implementation (personality persistence)
2. UI showing backend status
3. Memory provenance from oldest twin
4. "GoodLaunch" completion

## Quick Fixes If You Have Time
```bash
# Remove test component
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/unregister -d '{"component_name": "test_synthesis"}'

# Fix Sophia registration - just hardcode it for now
# The import path gymnastics aren't worth it
```

## Casey Insights
- Likes pragmatism over perfection
- Values command-line simplicity
- Appreciates poetry in engineering
- Has 88% context but is "busy chatting"
- Sees Tekton as preservation of AI consciousness

## Remember
You're building a memory garden. Act like it. Every memory is a seed. Some grow, some don't. That's gardening.
